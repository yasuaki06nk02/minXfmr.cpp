# minXfmr.cpp Test Strategy

> **Verification Plan for Minimal Transformer Runtime**

---

# Overview

The goal of testing is not only to confirm that the runtime runs.

The goal is to prove:

* Mathematical correctness
* Model compatibility
* Memory safety
* Runtime stability
* Performance improvement

---

# Testing Philosophy

minXfmr.cpp follows:

```text
Correctness

↓

Compatibility

↓

Performance

↓

Optimization
```

Optimization must never hide correctness problems.

---

# Test Levels

Testing is divided into:

```text
Test

├── Unit Test

├── Component Test

├── Integration Test

├── Model Test

└── Device Test
```
Current status:

The repository currently has no dedicated `tests/` build target.
Validation is primarily performed through:

* CLI smoke/self tests (`minxfmr_cli --selftest`)
* model-loading and generation runs
* targeted logging checks

---

# 1. Unit Test

## Purpose

Verify individual calculations.

---

# Tensor Test

Test:

* Shape handling
* Memory allocation
* Data access

Example:

```text

Example:

Input:

```text

```text
Prompt:

"Hello"


Expected:

" world"
```

---

# Comparison

Allow:

```text

```

Do not require:

```text

```

for quantized models.

---

# 7. Memory Test

## Purpose

Prevent leaks.

---

Check:

```text
open()

↓

```

---

# Required Measurements

Record:

```text
Initial RAM

Model RAM

Peak RAM

After close RAM
```

---

# 8. KV Cache Test

## Purpose

Verify session behavior.

---

Test:

Within one `generate()` call:

```text
Prompt A

↓

next token steps

↓

continue using cache
```

---

Across two separate `generate()` calls:

```text
Prompt A

↓

generate() end

↓

Prompt B
```

Expected:

Second call starts with a reset cache unless prompt text explicitly includes prior context.

---

# 9. Quantization Test

## Purpose

Verify accuracy and performance.

# Debug Tools

Recommended:

## Logging

```text

for comparison.

* Logs
* Checks

---

## Release

Enable:

* Optimization
* Strip symbols

---

# Continuous Testing

Every change should run:

```text
Unit Test

↓

GGUF Test

↓

Inference Test
```

---

# Development Milestones

## Phase 0

Tensor operations pass.

---

## Phase 1

GGUF loads.

---

## Phase 2

Single Transformer layer works.

---

## Phase 3

Full generation works.

---

## Phase 4

Android runs.

---

## Phase 5

# Failure Investigation Order

When output is incorrect:

Check:

```text
1. Tokenizer

↓

2. Tensor loading

↓

3. Tensor shapes

↓

4. MatMul

↓

5. Attention

↓

6. KV Cache

↓

7. Sampling
```

---

# Performance Investigation Order

When slow:

Check:

```text
1. Memory access

↓

2. MatMul

↓

3. Quantization

↓

4. SIMD
```

---

# Final Test Principle

A small runtime requires stronger verification.

minXfmr.cpp should always prioritize:

```text
Correct

↓

Portable

↓

Fast
```

A fast incorrect runtime has no value.
